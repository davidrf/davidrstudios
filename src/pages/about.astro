  <p>
    Hi, I’m David — a shark diver, underwater videographer, and ocean safari guide based on the North Shore of Oahu.
    I specialize in ethical wildlife encounters and cinematic underwater storytelling. Whether you’re booking a private
    shoot or joining an expedition, my work is all about capturing the raw beauty of the ocean with intention and respect.
  </p>

  <h2 class="font-heading text-2xl mt-10">From Zero to Depth</h2>
  <p>
    I moved to Hawaii three years ago knowing almost nothing about freediving or underwater videography. Today, I work
    full-time as a shark safety diver and ocean guide, capturing tiger sharks, humpbacks, dolphins, and hammerheads on camera
    while leading global expeditions in places like the Galápagos, Baja, and French Polynesia.
  </p>

  <h2 class="font-heading text-2xl mt-10">What Makes My Work Different</h2>
  <p>
    I don’t just point a camera — I build trust with wildlife, move with intention, and know how to guide others through it too.
    My style blends a technical understanding of gear with a documentary mindset and artistic color grading, helping clients
    and collaborators tell stories that resonate.

  <h2 class="font-heading text-2xl mt-10">What Is an Ethical Ocean Safari?</h2>
  <p>
    An ethical ocean safari is a small-group, respectful wildlife experience where we observe marine animals without baiting or harassment.
    The animals set the pace — we simply follow, float, and capture what they offer us.
